# NGeniusClient Stability Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the `NGeniusClient` class to address PED communication stability, command flow, and error handling issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Reconnection Stability
**Problem**: PED connection is temporarily lost and re-established by NGPAS. The client code did not handle such scenarios gracefully.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `Connect()` method with retry logic (up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff)
- Modified `Send()` method to detect connection failures and automatically reconnect
- Added proper cleanup and state management during reconnection attempts

### 2. Command Flow Adjustment 
**Problem**: Frequent `getStatus()` calls without adequate delays result in error 110 ("Previous command still in progress").

**Solution**:
- Implemented exponential backoff mechanism in `PollUntilCompleteAsync()`
- Delays increase progressively: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 30s (max)
- Counter resets on successful responses to restart backoff progression
- Enhanced logging to track consecutive error occurrences

### 3. Empty Response Handling
**Problem**: Occasionally, `getStatus()` returns an empty response without any retry logic.

**Solution**:
- Added retry logic in `GetStatus()` method for empty/null responses
- Up to 3 retry attempts with progressive delays
- Graceful fallback to empty JObject on persistent failures

## Key Improvements

### Configuration Constants
```csharp
private const int MaxRetryAttempts = 3;
private const int MaxConnectionRetryAttempts = 3;
private const int BaseBackoffDelayMs = 1000;
private const int MaxBackoffDelayMs = 30000;
```

### Connection Stability
- Automatic detection of network failures
- Exponential backoff for connection retries
- Proper exception handling for various network error types

### Error Handling
- Categorized exception handling (SocketException, IOException, etc.)
- Enhanced logging with attempt counts and delays
- Graceful degradation on persistent failures

### Backoff Algorithm
```csharp
var backoffDelay = Math.Min(
    BaseBackoffDelayMs * (int)Math.Pow(2, consecutiveError110Count - 1), 
    MaxBackoffDelayMs
);
```

## Benefits

1. **Increased Reliability**: Automatic recovery from temporary connection issues
2. **Reduced Error 110 Occurrences**: Progressive delays prevent overwhelming the PED
3. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful handling of empty responses and network failures
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting and monitoring
5. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes maintain existing API contracts

## Testing

The improvements have been tested with:
- Exponential backoff calculation verification
- Empty response detection logic
- Network exception handling scenarios

## Configuration

All retry limits and delays are configurable via constants at the class level, making it easy to adjust behavior based on deployment requirements.
